- Each region consists of 2 or more availability zones
- Isolated from other AWS Regions
## Availability Zone
- Availability Zones are physically separate and isolated from each other
- AZs span one or more data centres
- Each AZ is designed as an independent failure zone
## Local Zone

- Extension of an AWS Region where you can run your latency sensitive applications
## Edge Location
- Edge locations are Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoints for [[Amazon CloudFront]]
