# AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Summary
Support decision making, when building systems on AWS, on 5 pillars:
- [Operational Excellence Pillar](#Operational%20Excellence%20Pillar)
- [Security Pillar](#Security%20Pillar)
- [Reliability Pillar](#Reliability%20Pillar)
- [Performance Efficiency Pillar](#Performance%20Efficiency%20Pillar)
- [Cost Optimization Pillar](#Cost%20Optimization%20Pillar)

## Operational Excellence Pillar
- Support development and run workloads effectively
- Gain insight into workload operations
- Continuously improve processes and procedures to deliver business value
- Best practices for operational excellence:
	- Perform operations as code
	- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
	- Refine operations procedures frequently
	- Anticipate failure
	- Learn from all operational failures

## Security Pillar
- Protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security
- Best practices for security:
	- Implement a strong identity foundation
	- Enable traceability
	- Apply security at all layers
	- Automate security best practices
	- Protect data in transit and at rest
	- Keep people away from data
	- Prepare for security events

## Reliability Pillar
- Ensuring a workload can perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to
- This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle
- Best practices for reliability:
	- Automatically recover from failure
	- Test recovery procedures
	- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
	- Stop guessing capacity
	- Manage change in automation

## Performance Efficiency Pillar
- The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
- Best practices for performance efficiency:
	- Democratize advanced technologies
	- Go global in minutes
	- Use serverless architectures
	- Experiment more often
	- Consider mechanical sympathy
## Cost Optimization Pillar
- The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
- Best practices for cost optimization:
	- Implement Cloud Financial Management
	- Adopt a consumption model
	- Measure overall efficiency
	- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
	- Analyze and attribute expenditure
